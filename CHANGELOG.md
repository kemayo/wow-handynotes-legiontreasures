# Changelog

## Changed in v9

* TOC for 7.1.
* Include Emerald Winds, even though it's not technically a treasure.
* Some helpful notes clarifying positions.
* Missing Suramar treasure.

## Changed in v8

* Added more treasures to Suramar.
* More entrances in Highmountain, also finally all the parts of the slow fall toy.
* Fixed some treasures in Val'sharah, and noted some places where phasing requirements exist.
* Fixed the Temple of Fal'adora marker on the Suramar surface so it won't vanish until you've gotten both the treasures below it.

## Changed in v7

* Tweaked the rare icon size.
* Highmountain got a number of cave entrances marked.
* Added more notes / fixes. (Thanks to: LaoTseu, Victaliaa. Ssateneth, DKong27)

## Changed in v6

* Added rares to all zones, because I got tired of people complaining and it's not like I don't have the dataset available from [SilverDragon](https://mods.curse.com/addons/WoW/silver-dragon).
* Added more Highmountain grapple points.
* Made grapple point icon more visible.

## Changed in v5

* Show item previews in an attached tooltip rather than squeezing them into the main tooltip.
* Change the item-icon setting default to false, and have it affect achievement icons and currency icons as well. Makes for a more legible map, on the whole.
* Given their rarity in this expansion, give nodes with an actual item a special icon.
* Separate nodes added for cave entrances / grapple points leading to treasures.
* Fixes in Stormheim.

## Changed in v4

* Fixes to treasures in Azsuna, Val'sharah, and Stormheim.
* Debug option for bug reporters: "show quest id".

## Changed in v3

* Lots of new treasures in: Stormheim, Suramar
* A few missing treasures in: Azsuna, Highmountain, Val'sharah
* Fixed Demon Hunter starting vault treasures to only display on the correct floors.

## Changed in v2

* Fix the default icons, since Blizzard changed ObjectIconsAtlas around.

## Changed in v1

* Initial dataset: limited coverage of all Legion zones.
* Special handling for artifact-power as a fake currency, rather than just adding in a random power item.

## Changed in v0.1

* Initial framework for display.
